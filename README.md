# getDirections

A couple Node scripts for getting directions or geocoding an address and saving to geojson. Uses Google Maps API's Node client library to get the directions, Mapbox's polyline to decode into coordinate pairs, and saves locally as a geojson. Requires a Google Maps API key(first $300 free).

# getDirections

A short Node script to get directions from point A to point B and save as geojson. Uses Google Maps API's Node client library to get the directions, Mapbox's polyline to decode into coordinate pairs, and saves locally as a geojson. Requires a Google Maps API key(first $300 free). I built this so I can generate and visualize hundreds of theoretical migration routes.
